My current technical and research interests focus on artificial intelligence, security, web development, computer simulations and shader languages. I am particularly interested in real-time computer simulations and how shaders can convert those simulations into a beautiful scenery.

I really enjoy mountainbiking and bouldering. I am also interested to see new technological innovations in motorsports like the Formula 1, which always result in very exciting competitions.
