# Impact of the North Atlantic circulation on the climate in Europe
<img loading="lazy" src="images/projects/OceanCurrents/gulf_stream_visu.webp" alt="North Atlantic circulation"/>

The North Atlantic circulation, particularly the Gulf Stream, plays a critical role in shaping Western and Central Europe's climate. This system transports warm water from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic, influencing the air temperature above it and subsequently affecting Europe's weather through westerly winds. When this water reaches near Iceland, it cools and sinks, flowing back towards the Gulf of Mexico.

With ongoing climate change, there's a concern that this circulation might weaken, potentially leading to a paradoxical cooling effect in Europe amidst global warming. This could be influenced by factors like the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which introduces fresh water into the North Atlantic, disrupting the water's density and circulation strength.

# Project goal
Our project aims to investigate the North Atlantic circulation's current state and its influence on Europe's climate. Utilizing datasets from [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), we'll examine if there's evidence of the North Atlantic circulation weakening. Our focus areas are the warming Gulf of Mexico and the cooling North Atlantic, indicated as the red (warm) and blue (cold) regions in our study.

# Data Utilized
<img loading="lazy" src="images/projects/OceanCurrents/datasets.webp" alt="HYCOM"/>

We have decided to use the following datasets for our analysis:
 - HYCOM: Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, Water Temperature and Salinity
 - HYCOM: Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, Water Velocity

## Dataset Properties
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Spatial resolution | 1/12Â° |
| Temporal resolution | 1992-10-02 to present<br>3h spacing |
| Bands | Temperature (C)<br>Salinity (psu)<br>Velocity_x (m/s)<br>Velocity_y (m/s) |
| Depths | 0m - 500m across 40 levels |

## Data Extraction
Our dataset initially encompassed over 10600 days of images, 8 images per day, and 4*40 bands per image. To manage this vast data, we:
 - Reduced temporal resolution to weekly averages, yielding 1500 images
 - Applied spatial resolution reduction techniques, calculating statistical measures like minimum, maximum, mean, median, variance, and skewness for each area of interest

This approach significantly compressed the data, leaving us with about 1000 weekly values per region, totaling around 23MB of data per area.

# Analysis
## Temperature

Surface temperatures reflect seasonal changes more prominently, while deeper levels maintain steadier temperatures. Notably, the Gulf Stream ensures the warm region remains warmer than the cold region. Over the decades, the warm region's temperatures have risen, whereas the cold region exhibits a slight cooling trend.

## Salinity

<img loading="lazy" src="images/projects/OceanCurrents/salinity_cold.webp" alt="Salinity Cold"/>

Salinity trends are more pronounced, with the warm region experiencing increased salinity in both shallow and deep waters. Conversely, the cold region's salinity decreases, possibly due to fresh water influx from melting ice. These trends suggest a weakening in the North Atlantic circulation.

## Velocity
Our velocity data analysis showed significant instability, particularly in shallow waters. Therefore, we focused on deeper water velocities, measuring them as the euclidean norm of the x- and y-direction velocities.

<img loading="lazy" src="images/projects/OceanCurrents/velocity_cold.webp" alt="Velocity Cold"/>

The velocity data indicated a slight reduction in water movement in the warm region and a marginal increase in the cold region. However, the minimal scale of these changes (in m/s) makes this data less definitive than temperature and salinity findings.

## Correlation between temperature and salinity across multiple depths

<img loading="lazy" src="images/projects/OceanCurrents/correlation_cold.webp" alt="Correlation Cold"/>

A noteworthy observation is the varying correlation between temperature and salinity at different depths. In both regions, these factors show an inverse correlation in shallower waters, a direct correlation around 600m depth, and no significant correlation beyond 1200m depth. The reasons for these patterns remain a subject for further research.

# Conclusion
Our findings indicate a decrease in temperature and salinity in the North Atlantic's colder region, contrasting with increases in the warmer Gulf of Mexico region. These trends align with the hypothesis of a weakening North Atlantic circulation.
