# Overview
This project goes beyond just recreating the popular word game - it includes multiple AI solving strategies, multi-language support, and both terminal and web interfaces. You can try it out live at [https://wordle.tilmohr.com](https://wordle.tilmohr.com).

# Implementation
The project is structured into several packages:
- **Game Engine**: Core Wordle logic that's language-agnostic
- **CLI Interface**: Terminal-based game and AI assistant
- **Web Frontend**: Browser version built with Leptos and WebAssembly
- **AI Solver**: Multiple strategies with different trade-offs

The system supports both English and German wordlists, including proper handling of umlauts (ä, ö, ü, ß) in the German version.

I implemented four distinct AI approaches, as taken from [this great Medium article](https://medium.com/@dliao_/building-a-wordle-ai-8ddfd4627ece):
- **Random** - Pure random guessing as a baseline
- **Random-Updates** - Filters valid words after each guess and picks randomly
- **Heuristic** - Uses letter frequency analysis to make intelligent guesses based on common patterns in the language
- **Entropy** - Maximizes information gain with each guess

# Performance & Insights
To evaluate the AI strategies, I built a simulation framework that can run thousands of games and compare success rates and average guesses needed. The heuristic approach strikes the best balance - it's nearly as effective as the entropy method but runs much faster.
