# Overview
This project was meant to be an entrypoint into the world of web development. I have done some plain html + css + js websites before, but those didn't have any purpose. I knew I wanted to create my [personal website](https://tilmohr.com), so I thought of this project as an excersie before starting with my personal website.

# Implementation
## Frontend
The frontend was developed using the [Nuxt.js Framework](https://nuxtjs.org/). I also used the [Vuetify Material Design Framework](https://vuetifyjs.com/), so I could create a visual appealing UI with ease.

## Backend
The backend uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) python library and stores messages in a [sqlite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) database.
