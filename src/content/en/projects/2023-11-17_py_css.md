# Overview
For our "Information Retrieval and Text Mining" course at the University of Stavanger, we were tasked with creating cutting-edge conversational search engines and putting them to the test. Teaming up with Ishaac Ourahou, we set out to tackle this challenge.

These conversational search engines are rooted in traditional information retrieval techniques. Initially, a swift first-pass retrieval phase sifts through possibly millions of documents, narrowing them down to a manageable few hundred or a thousand. The subsequent second-pass retrieval phase takes a deeper dive, re-ranking these documents based on how semantically relevant they are to the query. What sets conversational search engines apart is their need to factor in the context of the ongoing conversation. Right from the first-pass retrieval, the system must be attuned to the conversation's history and the current topic. This often involves transforming the immediate user query, which may hinge on prior interactions, into a standalone reformulation. This reformulation then guides the retrieval of documents from the index. The general architecture of these conversational search engines is illustrated in the figure below.

# Results
In our project, we crafted, tested, and compared four distinct retrieval pipelines, each one building on the foundation of its predecessor. Below is a recorded demo showcasing the performance of our most effective pipeline.
